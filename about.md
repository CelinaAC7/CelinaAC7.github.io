Hello!

I am a Geospatial Information Science Master candidate at the University of Texas at Dallas. For my master's research I intend to study the relationship between crime and micro-level places in Guyana, a South American country.

I am originally from Guanajuato, Mexico, but I migrated with my family to the USA when I was thirteen years old. I got my associates of Science from Richland Community College, and then went to get my B.S. in GIS from the University of Texas at Dallas. While finishing my B.S. I enrolled in the Fast Track Program which allowed me to take graduate courses that counted towards my B.S. and my Masters degree.

I am a first generation college graduate, I financed my eduation with scholarships and a part time job in the food industry. As a result, I have a strong work ethic and great customer service skills. 

### More Information

In my free time I enjoy watching crime shows, walking my two chihuahua-terrier-mix dogs, and tending to my garden.
